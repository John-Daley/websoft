<h2>S01</h2>
<p>TIL - John Daley jan 21, 2020.

    I have been using git for the duration of my time at university, sometimes rather poorly. 
    Because of this I knew a most of the basics inside of git and terminal, that being said, I had never
    used ssh and git hub. Because I have two factor authentication set up on my github, I was forced to learn to ssh
    into my git account instead of using my normal user name and password combination. I learned this in the best way possible
    , failing over and over while googling! In a shortened version I learned that to use ssh with git hub
    a user must first generate a new ssh key on their local machine, this can be done from terminal in linux, after that 
    a user must add said key to there github profile. after which the user must be sure to switch from a https
    origin to a the ssh origin, where I had issues with this because my clone was based on the https link. Because of this
    the all origins must be deleted and then set up again to contain the correct origin link. 
    after doing this I was able to continue as normal with the git. I also learned about version tagging which was a small
    but useful skill to have, considering I, with luck, will start working in just a few months as a consultant. I also 
    learned about git pages and have been fighting with it for a day. </p>

<h2>S02</h2>
<p>Do I have any previous experience with html/css/js - Not much, some basic html and css in a komvux course I took! 
   What role does Html/css/js have - Html is like the frame of a house, Css is like the painting and furnishing and JS is that the fan turns on when you press the power button! 
   browser-http-webserver interaction - The browser takes a url then sends a http request to the server to obtain the required data for that specific url then returns that information back to the browser to be rendered or updated, not sure how indepth you want to me to go about protocols, handshakes, and so on.  
   My TIL - Html, css and js can work together to make some wonderfully functional and visually appealing web sits and web apps.  
</p>

<h2>S03</h2>
<p>I do have a little experience with client side but using react
   I think working with JS, because its functional and interweaved with html/css is rather confusing some times. Compared
   to java or kotlin, oop based languages. 
   To work with this exercise I spent my time reading some tutorials and the lecture slides/resources. I had a lot of trouble because I 
   didn't know we were allowed to fetch locally. So I ended up using the node function in the terminal to download and save the file, the code is in the schools.html file, then loading the file using jquery. 
   Its good because I was forced to learn a lot about cors errors for the future XD 
   The duck is based off of the JS duck hunt game you showed as an example. 
   I want to get grade 3. My code is a mess and I will refactor and clean up the code and styling in the future.

<h2>S04</h2>
<p>I have some previous experience because I am writing this post web dev course. I have been using NPM and YARN for doing web
    applications and websites, local testing. I think it is nice to work with javascript,
    node and express. I am looking forward to explore more of the strengths of this set up. 
    I followed the instructions and I am looking for a grade 3. The lab was not very diffcult, but I only worked towards a 3. So I think it would be more diffcult if I was trying for a higher grade. 
    I think the TIL from this section is: js is a versital lang that can be adapted throughout the entire stack. Express and NPM are well documented and are part of the mern stack. Express is a viable backend framework.

<h2>S05</h2>
<p>The php language is nice to work with so far. But this is of course a very simple implementation and I used your boilerplate code so it will be more challenging in future projects
    I think php was a little more work to set up the express/node.js but after figuring out the xampp situation and getting sql and such through there I was happy to use php. 
    I mainly followed your instructions and also used the resources you linked. I use linx so I followed your instructions and it went smooth enough. I am satisfied with my result because I only want grade 3. 
    This sections of the course showed how Php could be used with xampp and apache to make a simple crud database app. It also showed uses for Php

<h2>S06</h2>
<p>My opinion on popular programming languages is : 
    1. Javascript is a versital language that can be used backend and front end. It does suffer from being loosely typed and that creates a lot of type errors. 
    I personally enjoy using react and typescript but I am still learning. 

    2. Java is a hugely used language that OOP and in my opinion easy to use. 
    
    3. Python is currently my favorite language, but mostly because I am learning data science and machine learning and its used very often there. I think that its easy to use, has use from backend, ml, oop, and more. 
    Human readable! 

    4. Php is a nice backend language that was very popular and still sees a lot of use. 

    5. Asp.net - c# is a nice combo for working with web apps and using the roles to support and backend and frontend in a single app. Used often in finanace online. Also plays well with azure cloud services. 
    
    My future stacks I am currently planning to work with are python for DS/ML and a MERN stack for my web app. 

    I used the USA because I grew up there I was interested on which states were using which language. 

    It showed that python had the highest interest over the last 12 months. 
    It also showed that asp.net and php were the two lowest. 

    It was obvious from the map which states were the big "tech" states in the USA. Very interesting for future planning. 

    I would recommend a MERN stack because they are well supported, well documented and have been proven effective. I might use Typescript with react, redux and axios/ajax  for front end. 
    For backend I would use a Node/express combo again because they are industry tested and scale well. 
    Mongodb is a great final addition to this stack. 
    Its a common stack so its easy to get developers for also. 
    
    My TIL of this section is that there are many languages that appear to do the same thing but all have unique use cases, so being aware of them will really help me as a developer.
