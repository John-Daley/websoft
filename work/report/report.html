<h2>S01</h2>
<p>TIL - John Daley jan 21, 2020.

    I have been using git for the duration of my time at university, sometimes rather poorly. 
    Because of this I knew a most of the basics inside of git and terminal, that being said, I had never
    used ssh and git hub. Because I have two factor authentication set up on my github, I was forced to learn to ssh
    into my git account instead of using my normal user name and password combination. I learned this in the best way possible
    , failing over and over while googling! In a shortened version I learned that to use ssh with git hub
    a user must first generate a new ssh key on their local machine, this can be done from terminal in linux, after that 
    a user must add said key to there github profile. after which the user must be sure to switch from a https
    origin to a the ssh origin, where I had issues with this because my clone was based on the https link. Because of this
    the all origins must be deleted and then set up again to contain the correct origin link. 
    after doing this I was able to continue as normal with the git. I also learned about version tagging which was a small
    but useful skill to have, considering I, with luck, will start working in just a few months as a consultant. I also 
    learned about git pages and have been fighting with it for a day. </p>

<h2>S02</h2>
<p>Do I have any previous experience with html/css/js - Not much, some basic html and css in a komvux course I took! 
   What role does Html/css/js have - Html is like the frame of a house, Css is like the painting and furnishing and JS is that the fan turns on when you press the power button! 
   browser-http-webserver interaction - The browser takes a url then sends a http request to the server to obtain the required data for that specific url then returns that information back to the browser to be rendered or updated, not sure how indepth you want to me to go about protocols, handshakes, and so on.  
   My TIL - Html, css and js can work together to make some wonderfully functional and visually appealing web sits and web apps.  
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>S03</h2>
<p>I do have a little experience with client side but using react
   I think working with JS, because its functional and interweaved with html/css is rather confusing some times. Compared
   to java or kotlin, oop based languages. 
   To work with this exercise I spent my time reading some tutorials and the lecture slides/resources. I had a lot of trouble because I 
   didn't know we were allowed to fetch locally. So I ended up using the node function in the terminal to download and save the file, the code is in the schools.html file, then loading the file using jquery. 
   Its good because I was forced to learn a lot about cors errors for the future XD 
   The duck is based off of the JS duck hunt game you showed as an example. 
   I want to get grade 3. My code is a mess and I will refactor and clean up the code and styling in the future.  
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>S04</h2>
<p>I have some previous experience because I am writing this post web dev course. I have been using NPM and YARN for doing web
    applications and websites, local testing. I think it is nice to work with javascript,
    node and express. I am looking forward to explore more of the strengths of this set up. 
    I followed the instructions and I am looking for a grade 3. The lab was not very diffcult, but I only worked towards a 3. So I think it would be more diffcult if I was trying for a higher grade. 
    I think the TIL from this section is: js is a versital lang that can be adapted throughout the entire stack. Express and NPM are well documented and are part of the mern stack. Express is a viable backend framework.   
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>S05</h2>
<p>The php language is nice to work with so far. But this is of course a very simple implementation and I used your boilerplate code so it will be more challenging in future projects
    I think php was a little more work to set up the express/node.js but after figuring out the xampp situation and getting sql and such through there I was happy to use php. 
    I mainly followed your instructions and also used the resources you linked. I use linx so I followed your instructions and it went smooth enough. I am satisfied with my result because I only want grade 3. 
    This sections of the course showed how Php could be used with xampp and apache to make a simple crud database app. It also showed uses for Php
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>S06</h2>
<p>My opinion on popular programming languages is : 
    1. Javascript is a versital language that can be used backend and front end. It does suffer from being loosely typed and that creates a lot of type errors. 
    I personally enjoy using react and typescript but I am still learning. 

    2. Java is a hugely used language that OOP and in my opinion easy to use. 
    
    3. Python is currently my favorite language, but mostly because I am learning data science and machine learning and its used very often there. I think that its easy to use, has use from backend, ml, oop, and more. 
    Human readable! 

    4. Php is a nice backend language that was very popular and still sees a lot of use. 

    5. Asp.net - c# is a nice combo for working with web apps and using the roles to support and backend and frontend in a single app. Used often in finanace online. Also plays well with azure cloud services. 
    
    My future stacks I am currently planning to work with are python for DS/ML and a MERN stack for my web app. 

    I used the USA because I grew up there I was interested on which states were using which language. 

    It showed that python had the highest interest over the last 12 months. 
    It also showed that asp.net and php were the two lowest. 

    It was obvious from the map which states were the big "tech" states in the USA. Very interesting for future planning. 

    I would recommend a MERN stack because they are well supported, well documented and have been proven effective. I might use Typescript with react, redux and axios/ajax  for front end. 
    For backend I would use a Node/express combo again because they are industry tested and scale well. 
    Mongodb is a great final addition to this stack. 
    Its a common stack so its easy to get developers for also. 
    
    My TIL of this section is that there are many languages that appear to do the same thing but all have unique use cases, so being aware of them will really help me as a developer.

<h2>S07</h2>
<p>This lab was about .NET technologies. 
    1. Try to explain the platform .NET (C#, ASP.NET) to a skilled programmer, but newbie to this Microsoft technology.
    If I were to explain .NET to a a fellow programmer I would say the following. 
    It is an open source platform that can be used to build full stack web applications. It can be used for frontend and backend. 
    It is written in C# and can be connected to other front end frameworks. 
    It connects "easly" to azure cloud services. 
    It contains worker roles and web roles, web roles are "front end/UI" and the worker roles are used for "backend".
    It can also be used to build console applications. 
    It is a popular platform to work with and supports many popular libraries and such. 
    Often uses MVC( model view controller). 
    If it is used with visual studio IDE there is a lot of functionality and code that can be generated for the developer.
    It can be used cross platform on mobile devices with xamarin
    The package manager is called NuGet and contains 90000 packages.
    Its a trusted, secure and well optimized platform to work with.        
    
    2. Elaborate by comparing .NET technologies with the other technologies we learned during the course.
    I think of comparing it to a MERN stack, as it can be used to do everything that a JS/express,nodejs application( and connecting to the database) but in a single framework. It is also nice because you can write in c# for both front and backend. 

    3. Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the result?
    I appoarched this task by following you example code and tutorials online. I am aiming for a 3 and I am satisfied with the work because I learned a lot even if its not very pretty or complex. 

    4. What is your TIL for this course section?
    Learn to build different applicaitons with .net and c#.
    It is a trusted and well documented platform and also popular. 
    MVC in practice and a deeper understanding of its connection to asp.net

<h2>S08</h2>
<p> For this lab I preformed an mini analysis of 3 web sites
    I chose to look at reddit, towards data science and roll20. 
    1. roll20 - I have used this for dnd and It has felt slow before and unpolished, so I was interested to see how it did in the analysis
              - Roll 20 did rather poorly with 14 in performance. But its did ok in the other areas messured, see the data doc for more details 

    2. reddit - I am on reddit a decent amount and always use a mobile app, It was interesting to see how poorly reddit scored on preformance in my tests. 
              - Reddit's performance was 1 and 0 in the 2 tests I ran, that is very low. But using the website you can feel these issues. Reddit also got a 100 in SEO interestingly enough. Also scored a 86 in best practices 

    3. Towards data science - I use this website a lot for research and my thesis and always seem to run snappy and smooth so I was interested to see how well it did.
                            - Towards data sciences had the best overall performance with 35. It runs well on mediums platform 

    <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14x_5AJNyV1Ywtt7uRT-06RyXn9Fa8VkeDLhKNt1MwQI/edit?usp=sharing">Click me for data!! </a>
    
    TIL
    This section of the course helped me learn about web performance analysis using tools such as lighthouse. 
    There is many optimizations that can be made to improve a web site performance. 
    Optimizations should be used when needed and not focused on to early in development.

<h2>S09</h2>
<p>The following are the 3 security issues: 
    1. Someone one try to drop all tables in a sql database. This was common as a joke when were were testing each others applications
    during the earlier courses. This is called Injects and is 1 on the OWASP list of web app security risks. This happens when someone sends extra "text" with a sql query, maybe from a web form, and can preform operations on the DB 
    
    2. Badly set user permissions have caused issues in places I have worked previously. Primarly from empolyees accessing thing that they should not be allowed to access. 
    This could also be abused by a attacker to get access to services or data that could be abused for future attacks. This is 5 on the OWASP list which is broken access control. 

    3. Someone using XSS for redirects is a concern of mine. This can expose the user to malicious sites, be used to hijack a user session and more. Number 7 on the OWASP list. 


    New web programmer guide: 
    If I was going to give a guide to a new web programmer I would say the following things: 
    1. Be sure to do indepth research about headers, this is a easy attack vector for hackers and is still an issue on old websites today. 
    2. Make a security plan - meet with the team and discuss the different users and what they should be able to do on the application. Also look for potential threats and use abstraction. 
    3. Do threat analysis regularly.  
    4. Use authetication from a cloud service if possible. They will handle a lot of the risk for you. 
    5. Make sure to use encryption and be sure to make sure you are using something like sha256 or newer to avoid security messures that are already broken
    6. Keep good logs and make sure to hide error messages from users, use a custom error message instead. 
    7. Be aware of XSS and Insecure deserialization. 
   
    TIL: There are many attack vectors in web application development and must be avoid at all costs. There is plenty of information on being secure when building a web app, but they change quickly. OWASP is a good place to start for keeping track of current high risk threats.

<h2>S10</h2>
<p>
   1. Write a general paragraph about how the project was implemented.
   Problems / solutions / simple / difficult / fast / long time, etc.
   
   2. Was the project easy or difficult? Did it take a long time? 
   The project was very difficult and took more time then expected. I think this is a large part because of covid and other factors outside of the course.accept-policy
   I think it also was partly due to over reaching in the design. 
   
   3. What was difficult and what went easy?
   Well it was diffcult in the start to really design properly and estimate time. 
   We really wanted to try to build the project in a manor that would allow for us to practice our skills that will help us get jobs in the future. 
   Because of this I personally spent a lot of time learning to use Redux. Another large time sink was converting our update information form to be a multistep wizard forum.  I was able to complete it but it took much more time then required
   Dealing with Json files in different formats was also personally diffcult to me and I will be studying that for a bit after school ends to prepare for work. 

   A lot went easy also, using react,redux,express,node.js and mysql really provided a lot of resources and also allowed our team to work with JS over the entire stack. 
   Routing and setting up firebase authetication went easier then expected.
   My project mate and I worked well together. I felt that we pair programmed a lot and were both open to trying to push our skills to another level, we were successful but in a scaled down version of what we wanted to create. 

   4. Was this a good and reasonable project for this course? How was it to work in a team?
   I think this project matched very well to the course, it allowed for growth and had good requirements at each grading level. It really opens the door for the student to set the diffculty level ( of course meeting the requirements. )
   I really enjoyed working in a team with my classmate, I had hoped we would have in person coding sessions but covid concerns pushed us to a primarly remote style work flow. We used trello to track our back log and worked well together. 


   5. Finish with a final paragraph with your thoughts on the course and what you think about the material and the guide (about 5-10 sentences). 
   Great course, easy to follow, and that helps a lot when learning new areas of web dev, even if you are stuck at a distance

   6. Provide feedback to teachers and suggest any improvement suggestions for upcoming course opportunities.
   I think the biggest thing would be to contiune what you are doing, its really a nice course set up and good instructions. 
   Could be nice to have a bit more time with the frameworks. Maybe less time in the start up of the course? 
   
   7. Are you satisfied / dissatisfied?
   I am satisfied. Really one of the best courses we have had, in structure and skills learned. Also the professor was knowledgeable and that really helps when I encountered problems.    
  
   8. Will you recommend the course to your friends / colleagues? On a scale of 1-10, what grade do you give the course?
   Yes, this course we well structured and contained a huge amount of information but did a good job on not being too much. 
   I would give the course a 9 or 9.5, one of the best we had in school and I didnt even get to attend a lot of the lectures because of life situations. 

What is your final TIL for this course?
Intro to most areas of the stack and many technologies. 
Well organized and great teacher. 
A good developer should focus on learning one stack very well and have knowledgeable of the area technologies used. 
Javascript and backend are not as scary as I thought! 
Thanks!
